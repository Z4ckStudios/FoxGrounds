### Description:
<div>Welcome to Project FoxGrounds! (FoxGrounds for short)</div>
<div>say.. do you know what Discord is? If not, head on over to https://discord.com.</div>
<div>I like Discord but I'd rather not pay for subscription based services..</div>

<p></p>
<div>What is FoxGrounds?</div>
<div>Imagine a chat service where you can completely customize every aspect to your liking,
  fonts would be server-sided to allow great diversity,
  you would be able to customize chat frames,
and as the project evolves, I'm hoping for limitless possibilities!!</div>

<p></p>
<div>The best part? This'll all be done for completely free!</div>

### Disclaimer:
<p>FoxGrounds is not made out of hate for Discord but I feel like I speak for most when I say that a free customizable chat service would benefit a lot of people!</p>
